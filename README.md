# Letter Boxed Solver

This is a simple solver for the "Letter Boxed" game in the New York Times.

It's a way for me to play with and learn the Rust programming language.

The word list comes from [https://github.com/elasticdog/yawl](https://github.com/elasticdog/yawl) and is Public Domain.

At time of writing the README there are no tests or anything like that. This was simply a bit of fun.

Enjoy!
